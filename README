Credit Card Tools
=================

These are a set of ruby scripts for processing credit cards on the command
line.

Supported processors:

  * PayPal (Business or Premier account required)

Requirements
------------

  * RubyGems
  * ActiveMerchant

Setup
-----

Copy gateway.yml.example to gateway.yml and fill in the 3 fields in that file.

Install ActiveMerchant::

  gem install activemerchant

If the following files are not set executable, you should do::

  chmod 755 charge.rb refund.rb

Usage
-----

Commands:

  * charge.rb
  * refund.rb

Run the commands without arguments to see the options.

Example $1.00 charge::

  ./charge.rb 1.00 4111111111111111 02/2012

Example $1.00 refund::

  ./refund.rb 1.00 2TL24258DY409104G

The second argument in the above example is the Auth ID of the original 
transaction.

The output will be a nicely formatted response from PayPal.  The response is
in YAML format, so you could do further processing with your own scripts 
relatively easily.

Other Processors
----------------

ActiveMerchant supports a large list of credit card processors / gateways.
To use these tools with a gateway besides PayPal, modify gateway.rb to suit
your needs.  It should be relatively straight forward.
